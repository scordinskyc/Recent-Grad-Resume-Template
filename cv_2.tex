\textbf{Conference Presentation}\\
Mid-Atlantic Pathologists’ Assistant Conference\\
Presented at University of Pennsylvania \\
“Erroneous Blood Glucose Measurements by Hand-Held Devices in Diabetic Patients Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis”, 2008\\
Abstract:
\begin{quote}
    
Stringent glycemic control is an essential paradigm in type II diabetics.  In cases where these patients have compromised renal function due to progression of the diabetes or from other concomitant pathologies, this protocol is even more critical.  Frequently, end stage renal disease patients receive continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.  With the advancement of icodextrin-containing dialysate, the threat of either hyperglycemia or alterations in peritoneal membrane ultrafiltration efficacy caused by the traditional dextrose-containing dialysate, is alleviated.  However, icodextrin undergoes biochemical transformation in vivo to produce maltose and maltose polymer metabolites which compromise the sensitivity of hand-held blood glucose monitors that rely on a pyrroloquinolinequinone-glucose dehydrogenase coupled mechanism of operation.  In a case study documented from literature, a patient was diagnosed as severely hyperglycemic using data from a hand-held device, when, in fact, the patient was severely hypoglycemic per data retrieved from the central laboratory.  Due to this overestimation, the patient was treated for hyperglycemia inappropriately.  Despite intervention with intravenous dextrose, the patient later expired.  Though certain labeling initiatives have been instituted by glucose meter manufacturers, under advisement by the Food and Drug Administration, there is serious demand for reiteration of the very dire consequences of overestimated blood glucose in these patients by hand-held devices.
